# compute-engine-quickstart

Simple startup script for Google Compute Engine used to start up Spring Boot services hosted on GitHub.

Add the contents of startup-script to the Custom Metadata of your Compute Engine instance, with the key "startup-script", then reset your instance. Any unexpected migrations or resets will then run the script to restart the service automatically.

Any output generated by this script (including the Spring Boot logs) can be found within your instance at /var/log/startupscript.log
